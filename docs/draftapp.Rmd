### Notes

Some things to keep in mind:

* This is using 'simulated' data because the format of the dataset isn't *exactly* right. But, the exposure/outcome combinations are only those that occur in the data.
* When you reach the 'deepest' part of the graph, clicking on an exposure/outcome combination should bring up the associated metadata, but it's not implemented yet. That screen is next on my list.
* There's currently no filter for age, but this is on my list.
* The CSS works OK for normal size screens, but is not responsive enough for mobile. 
* Some components are a bit laggy, but that will be fixed down the road.
* You can view the full-page version of the app [here](https://tarensanders.shinyapps.io/screen_viz).
