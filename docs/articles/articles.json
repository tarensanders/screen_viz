While some forms of screen use\n(e.g., television viewing) may be detrimental to health and well-being\n(Hale and Guan\n2015; Sweetser et al. 2012), evidence for\nother forms of screen exposure (e.g., video games or online\ncommunication, such as Zoom) remains less certain and, in some cases,\nmay even be beneficial (Li and\nAtkins 2004; Warburton and Highfield 2017). Further\nconfusing the issue is that screen time guidelines (e.g.,\nAustralian Government 2021; World\nHealth Organization 2019) typically focus on only the\nduration of screen time, despite mounting evidence that the issue is\nmore nuanced and the risks might be more closely associated with the\ncontent and environment (Elson et\nal. 2019).\nHampering the ability for parents to make informed decision is a lack\nof comprehensive and contemporary evidence. Indeed, in a 2019 editorial\nin the leading medical journal The Lancet (The\nLancet 2019), the editor wrote “Our understanding of the\nbenefits, harms, and risks of our rapidly changing digital landscape is\nsorely lacking.”, and a Nature Human Behaviour editor described\nit as “a defining question of our age” (Nature Human Behaviour 2019). Without\ncomprehensive information, it is no wonder that parents are struggling\nto make informed decisions (Elson et\nal. 2019).\nMeta-analyses—the process of combining multiple studies together to\nimprove the precision of the estimated effect size (Higgins et al. 2021)—are considered the\nhighest form of scientific evidence (Strauss 2008). To address the lack of\ncomprehensive information on the risks and benefits of screen time, our\nteam collated and synthesised all existing meta-analytic evidence on the\ninfluence of screen time on children’s health, education, and well-being\noutcomes. We reanalysed these studies to ensure the effect sizes were\ncomparable, giving us a set of almost 200 effect sizes. However, while\nwe now have a comprehensive set of information, communicating this\ninformation to parents is still a challenge.\nCommunicating science is\nhard\nFor people to make informed decisions, they need to understand the\nbenefits, risks, and other costs of their decision (Fischhoff 2013). But, communicating\ninformation in such a way that allows people to make these decisions is\nchallenging. According to Fischhoff (2013), good science communication can be\nbroken down into four tasks:\n\nTask 1. Identify the science most relevant to the\ndecisions that people face.\nTask 2. Determine what people already know.\nTask 3. Design communications to fill the critical\ngaps (between what people know and need to know).\nTask 4. Evaluate the adequacy of those\ncommunications.\n- Fischhoff (2013), pg. 14034\n\nAs described above, our team has already completed Task 1, and plenty\nof research exists regarding parents’ knowledge around screen time (i.e.,\nTask 2, see for example Hamilton et al. 2015). Therefore, this\nproject will focus on Task 3: creating a method to communicate science\nto fill an information gap.\nVisualising\ndata can make it easier to communicate\nOne way to communicate information that makes it simpler for people\nto make informed decisions is to visualise data (Munzner and Maguire 2015; Engebretsen\n2020). Data visualisation makes it simpler for people to\nparse the information provided, and use it to arrive at a sound\ndecision. There are numerous examples of this occurring. For example,\nThe New York Times used an interactive visualisation to show\nthe pros and cons of renting versus buying a house (Bostock, Carter,\nand Tse 2014)—a decision which can vary by a number of\nfactors. The website Information is beautiful used\nvisualisation to help people understand which treatments for COVID-19\nhave evidence for benefits, compared to those that do not (Information is Beautiful 2021).\nThe goal of this project, therefore, is to create a visualisation\nthat fills the information gap for parents regarding children’s screen\ntime behaviours.\nResearch Question\nThe research question for this project is:\n\nCan we develop a visualisation to help parents weigh the risks and\nbenefits of screen time on children’s health, education, and well-being\noutcomes?\n\nIn the process of addressing this research question, I will also\ninvestigate the following questions:\n\nWhat are the appropriate task abstractions to address the research\nquestion?\nWhat idioms best address the task abstractions, in order to address\nthe research question?\n\nMethods and Materials\nDataset\nThe dataset for this project comes from an umbrella review (also\nknown as a meta-meta-analysis) of the literature on screen time. To\nderive the dataset, we systematically searched 12 academic databases for\nmeta-analyses. Eligible studies were identified following screening in\nduplicate, and all effect sizes were extracted. If the meta-analyses\nprovided the original study data, these were also extracted. Where two\nor more meta-analyses analysed the same exposure/outcome combination, we\nselected the effect with the largest total sample size. Effect sizes\nwere converted to correlations (\\(r\\))\nusing appropriate formulas. We examined heterogeneity of the effect\nsizes using a the \\(I^2\\) measure, and\ntested for evidence of publication bias using Egger’s test and a test of\nexcess significance.\nThe dataset has the following features:\nEffect sizes with uncertainties. For each\nexposure/outcome combination, a correlation coefficient and confidence\ninterval are provided. Where possible, the effect sizes are drawn from\nre-analysis of the original study data, with a conversion of the\noriginal meta-analysis effect size used as a backup.\nHeterogeneity of the effect sizes. The \\(I^2\\) values measures the extent to which\nstudies within a meta-analysis are consistent. A high \\(I^2\\) indicates a large amount of\nunexplained variability in the finding (that is, the effect may not\noccur for all participants).\nStudy characteristics. Effect sizes drawn from many\nlarge studies will produce more precise effect estimates than a few\nsmall studies. The dataset includes the total sample size (\\(N\\)) and the number of studies the pooled\neffect is drawn from (\\(k\\)).\nAge group. As it is reasonable for the effect of\nscreen time to vary by age, the age group for each effect size is\nprovided.\nEvidence of statistical credibility. Pooled effect\nsizes are only as good as the studies from which they are drawn. For\nexample, if only positive studies are published but negative studies are\nnot, the pooled effect size will show a positive result where none\nexists (known as publication bias). The dataset includes tests for\npublication bias.\nMethodology\nThe methodology for this project will follow the steps outlined by\nMunzner and Maguire\n(2015). For each piece of information the\nusers sees, a three step process is followed:\nIdentify what data should be shown to the\nuser;\nIdentify why a user would be using a visualisation\ntool to view this data (i.e., task abstraction); and,\nIdentify how the data can best be displayed (i.e.,\nwhich idiom to use).\nThese series of steps can be chained together, so the output of one\nstep can be used as input to the next step.\nThere are a number of ways to approach each of these steps. One\napproach for determining the what and the why aspects\nis to consult with domain experts or stakeholders (in this case,\nparents). Given the contained time limit on the project, consulting with\nstakeholders is difficult, so I will instead rely on my own and others\ndomain expertise.\nThe initial version of the system will aim to include 3-5 task\nabstractions. Some possible examples of the included abstractions could\nbe:\nComparing risks and benefits for a specific outcome (e.g., video\ngames);\nIdentifying which evidence is strong and which evidence is weak;\nor\nIdentifying ways that an exposure can be modified to reduce a risk\n(e.g., co-viewing may decrease risks associated with television).\nExpected Outcome\nThe expected outcome for this project is a visualisation system that\ncan help parents make informed decisions about their children’s screen\ntime. Given how prevalent concerns around screen time are, ideally the\nsystem could be given to a third-party with greater access to parents\n(e.g., the Raising Children Network). Further, given the rapid rate at\nwhich screen time evidence accumulates, the system would ideally be\nrobust to constantly updated information, with little maintenance to\nmaintain. That is, if new evidence became available for an exposure or\noutcome, it could be rapidly incorporated into the visualisation\nsystem.\nEthics\nAs there are no research participants in this project and the dataset\nconsists only of pooled effect sizes, there is no requirement for Human\nResearch Ethics Committee approval.\nTimeline\nA timeline for this project is provided in Figure\n1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Gantt chart for the capstone project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Government. 2021. “Physical Activity and Exercise\nGuidelines for All Australians.” Department of\nHealth.\n\n\nBostock, Mike, Shan Carter, and Archie Tse. 2014. “Is It Better to\nBuy or Rent?” The New York Times.\n\n\nElson, Malte, Christopher J.
