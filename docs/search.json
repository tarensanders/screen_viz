But, the exposure/outcome combinations are\nonly those that occur in the data.\nWhen you reach the ‚Äòdeepest‚Äô part of the graph, clicking on an\nexposure/outcome combination should bring up the associated metadata,\nbut it‚Äôs not implemented yet. That screen is next on my list.\nThere‚Äôs currently no filter for age, but this is on my list.\nThe CSS works OK for normal size screens, but is not responsive\nenough for mobile.\nSome components are a bit laggy, but that will be fixed down the\nroad.\nYou can view the full-page version of the app here.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nWelcome üëã\nThe purpose of this site is to host all of the files and notes\nrelated to the development of the Screen Time Vizualization.\nProviding Feedback\nProviding feedback on interactive documents is tricky. At the bottom\nof each page is a giscus comment box.\nComments made here are sent to the discussions\npage on GitHub. In order to add comments, you will need to sign in to\nGitHub and authorise the giscus app to make\ncomments on your behalf (don‚Äôt worry, this is safe). Here is my\nproposed workflow:\nFor each piece of feedback or idea, create a new comment.\nYou can reply to someone else‚Äôs (or your own) comment to keep ideas\ntogether, or upvote it if you think it is a good idea.\nYou‚Äôll recieve notifications from GitHub (√† la Google Docs) when\nsomeone responds to your comment. You can always turn these off.\nTo action feedback, I‚Äôll create a GitHub issue linked to the\ncomment, and respond to the comment when that issue is resolved.\nYou can also just post directly on the discussions\npage, or email me feedback.\nLinks üîó\nProject Rationale\nContains the rationale for the project and the objectives.\nProject\nSketches\nThese are the early mockups of the design. The focus is mostly on\nwhat idiom best displays the information, rather than on the actual\nstyle and design. That is: ‚Äúis this information clearer as a bar chart\nor heatmap?‚Äù, rather than ‚Äúdoes this look good?‚Äù.\nDraft App\nWhen an idiom design is finalised, I‚Äôll translate it into a page in a\nshiny app. The early builds are meant to be quick, so expect default\nstyling and clunky interactions. These get resolved once all of the\nscreens are built.\nRepository\nAll of the code, website pages, feedback, and issues are hosted on\nGitHub.\n\n\n\n",
