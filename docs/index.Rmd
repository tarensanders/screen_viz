# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

The purpose of this site is to host all of the files and notes related to the development of the Screen Time Vizualization.

## Providing Feedback

Providing feedback on interactive documents is tricky.
At the bottom of each page is a [giscus](https://giscus.app/) comment box.
Comments made here are sent to the [discussions](https://github.com/tarensanders/screen_viz/discussions/categories/comments) page on GitHub.
In order to add comments, you will need to sign in to GitHub and authorise the [giscus app](https://github.com/marketplace/giscus) to [make comments on your behalf](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps) (don't worry, this is safe).
Here is my proposed workflow:

* For each piece of feedback or idea, create a new comment.
* You can reply to someone else's (or your own) comment to keep ideas together, or upvote it if you think it is a good idea.
* You'll recieve notifications from GitHub (Ã  la Google Docs) when someone responds to your comment.
You can always turn these off.
* To action feedback, I'll create a GitHub issue linked to the comment, and respond to the comment when that issue is resolved.
* You can also just post directly on the [discussions page](https://github.com/tarensanders/screen_viz/discussions/categories/comments), or email me feedback.

## Links ðŸ”—

### [Project Rationale](articles/rationale/index.html)

Contains the rationale for the project and the objectives.

### [Project Sketches](articles/sketches/index.html)

These are the early mockups of the design.
The focus is mostly on what idiom best displays the information, rather than on the actual style and design.
That is: "is this information clearer as a bar chart or heatmap?", rather than "does this look good?".

### [Draft App](draftapp.html)

When an idiom design is finalised, I'll translate it into a page in a shiny app.
The early builds are meant to be quick, so expect default styling and clunky interactions.
These get resolved once all of the screens are built.

### [Repository](https://github.com/tarensanders/screen_viz)

All of the code, website pages, feedback, and issues are hosted on GitHub.
